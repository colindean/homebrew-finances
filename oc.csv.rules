# * hledger (1.27) conversion rules for OpenCollective CSV v2
# https://hledger.org/hledger.html#csv-format
#
# These are the rules used to convert data from the hledger collective.
# They should work pretty well for any collective, except you might
# need to change the fiscal host name "open-source-collective" where
# it's hard-coded below.
#
# OC's CSV data format changed in 2021. These rules cover both old and
# new formats, which complicates them but simplifies conversion.  For
# data that's only on one side of 2021-06-01, you could simplify these rules.
