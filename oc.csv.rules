# * hledger (1.25) conversion rules for OpenCollective CSV v2

# These are the rules used to convert data from the hledger collective.
# They should work pretty well for any collective, except you might
# need to change the fiscal host name where it's hard-coded below
# ("open-source-collective").
# OC changed their CSV data format in 2021. These rules cover both old
# and new formats, which complicates them but simplifies conversion.
# For data that's only on one side of 2021-06-01, they could be simplified.
